# Progressive Web App (PWA) Tryout

Demo: https://pwa-tryout.onrender.com/

The app followed this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/progressive-web-app-pwa-the-complete-guide/) with some additional features.

Most of PWA features were applied in this app, which are:

- Offline mode
- Web push notifications
- Background sync
- Home screen installation
  
The core source code of this app was from my [Static Web Boilerplate](https://github.com/hauph/static-web-boilerplate).
